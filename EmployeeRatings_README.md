# Employee Ratings Application

## Description
This project is a simple Employee Ratings Application built in Python. It allows users to manage employee data through a menu-driven interface. Users can view employee records, add new employees, and save data to a file. The system is divided into three main components:

- **Data Classes**: Handles data structures and constants.
- **Processing Classes**: Manages file I/O operations.
- **Presentation Classes**: Handles user input and output.

## Features

- **View Employees**: Display a list of all employee records.
- **Add Employee**: Input new employee data and update the records.
- **Save Data**: Save the employee data to a file for persistence.
- **Exit Program**: Safely exit the system.
